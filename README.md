# AWS-EC2-Virtual-Machine-Provisioning-Script
 high-level Python script for the EC2 Virtual Machine Provisioning project based on the outlined objectives and features. This script uses Boto3 for AWS SDK integration



###     The search_arch_linux_ami function searches for an Arch Linux Server AMI owned by the 'archlinux' account.
    The search_gentoo_ami function searches for a Gentoo AMI owned by the 'gentoo' account.
    Each function returns the first matching AMI found or None if no matching AMI is found.
    Feel free to customize the filters or handling logic based on specific requirements.

You can integrate these functions into your main provisioning script by importing them and calling them as needed.
